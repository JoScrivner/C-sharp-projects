A program I wrote in C# that can help bakery businesses in Hungary to create the necessary documentation for each product, according to Hungarian regulations. The program has a database of ingredients (with nutritional and allergen information) that can be modified (new items can be added and existing items can be edited or deleted). Part of the product documentation page is about the ingredients and the recipe of the product. After inputting the quantity of each ingredient, the program calculates the nutritional values of the final product and displays the allergens. (These can be manually edited if necessary). The documentation can be saved at any point and can be exported in PDF format.
